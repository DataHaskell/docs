Welcome to the beginner tutorials. The basic development setup suggested below intends to provide a starting point for beginners and a starting point to follow the workflow used in the other tutorials. Feel free to ignore or use an alternative setup of your preference.

## Dependencies

- Haskell [Stack](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started) build system
- [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) editor/IDE
- [Intero](https://haskell-lang.org/intero) Haskell interactive development extension for IDEs

## Basic workflow

- [reading a csv](http://howistart.org/posts/haskell/1/) Chris Allen has written a very approachable tutorial describing all the basic workflow from creating a Haskell project to reading a CSV file to summing how many *at bats* present in the file. It also showcases something that Haskell lets you more conveniently than other languages: streaming the data in constant memory.
