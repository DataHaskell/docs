<h2 id="datastructures">Data structures</h2>


<h3 id="dataframes">Data frames</h3>

- **frames** - [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Frames) : User-friendly, type safe, runtime efficient tooling for working with tabular data deserialized from comma-separated values (CSV) files. The type of each row of data is inferred from data, which can then be streamed from disk, or worked with in memory. Also see the comprehensive [tutorial](https://acowley.github.io/Frames/)
- **labels** - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/labels) : Declare and access tuple fields with labels. An approach to anonymous records.
- **analyze** - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/analyze), [github](https://github.com/ejconlon/analyze) : `pandas`-like dataframe operations for tabular data with CSV interface.
- **kraps-h** - [github](https://github.com/krapsh/kraps-haskell) : Haskell bindings to Apache Spark. The library consists of: 
  * a specification to describe data pipelines in a language-agnostic manner, and a communication protocol to submit these pipelines to Spark. 
  * a serving library, called krapsh-server, that implements this specification on top of Spark. It is written in Scala and is loaded as a standard Spark package.
  * a client written in Haskell that sends pipelines to Spark for execution. In addition, this client serves as an experimental platform for whole-program optimization and verification, as well as compiler-enforced type checking.

<h3 id="arrays">Efficient arrays</h3>

- **vector** - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector) : An efficient implementation of Int-indexed arrays (both mutable and immutable), with a powerful loop optimisation framework.
- **accelerate** - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate) : Data.Array.Accelerate defines an embedded array language for computations for high-performance computing in Haskell. Computations on multi-dimensional, regular arrays are expressed in the form of parameterised collective operations, such as maps, reductions, and permutations. These computations may then be online compiled and executed on a range of architectures.
- **repa** - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa) : Repa provides high performance, regular, multi-dimensional, shape polymorphic parallel arrays. All numeric data is stored unboxed.

    * Math.Probably.PDF defines some common parametric log-probability density functions
    * Math.Probably.FoldingStats defines statistics as folds that can be composed and calculated independently of the container of the underlying data.
    * Strategy.* implements various transition operators for Markov Chain Monte Carlo, including Metropolis-Hastings, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, NUTS, and continuous/discrete slice samplers.
    * Math.Probably.MCMC implements functions and combinators for running Markov chains and interleaving transition operators.

The interface for constructing models is isolated as much as possible from the specifics of a given algorithm, so swapping out a Kalman Filter for a Bayesian Particle Filter should involve a minimum of effort.
This implementation is designed to support symbolic types, such as from sbv or ivory. As a result you can generate code in another language, such as C, from a model written using this package; or run static analyses on your model.
