A list of data science and machine learning algorithms we would like to have,
along with existing implementations (if any).

Numerical methods
-----------------

### Numerical linear algebra

- hmatrix - [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix) : Bindings to BLAS/LAPACK. Linear solvers, matrix decompositions, and more.
- sparse-linear-algebra - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sparse-linear-algebra) : Native library for sparse algebraic computation. Linear solvers, matrix decompositions and related tools; functional but not optimized for efficiency yet.

### Integration

- Markov chain Monte Carlo
  - declarative - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/declarative) : A simple combinator language for Markov transition operators that are useful in MCMC.
  - mwc-probability  -  [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mwc-probability) : A simple probability distribution type, where distributions are characterized by sampling functions.


### Differentiation

- Automatic differentiation
  - ad - [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ad) : Automatic differentiation to arbitrary order, applicable to data provided in any Traversable container.


### Optimization

- Linear programming
  - glpk-hs - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/glpk-hs) : Friendly interface to GLPK's linear programming and mixed integer programming features. Intended for easy extensibility, with a general, pure-Haskell representation of linear programs. 

- Convex optimization
  - optimization - [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optimization) : A number of optimization techniques from the modern optimization literature (quasi-Newton, stochastic gradient descent, mirror descent, projected subgradient etc.).

Contribute
====

If you know a library that has to do with Data Science, please consider [adding](https://github.com/DataHaskell/docs/edit/gh-pages/_posts/2016-10-19-wishlist.md) it, if the category it belongs to doesn't exist, suggest a category for it.

Add sections related to data science and not only Machine Learning such as Data Mining, Distributed Processing, etc
