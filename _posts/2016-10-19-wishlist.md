A wishlist of data science and machine learning algorithms we would like to have,
along with existing implementations (if any).

Machine Learning
----------------

### Supervised Learning

#### Classification

- Neural Networks

  - Recurrent Neural Networks
  - Convolutional Neural Networks


- Nearest Neighbors

- Naive Bayes
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
       - sibe - [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sibe), [github](https://github.com/mdibaiee/sibe)
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes


- Support Vector Machines 

- Ensemble methods
  - Decision Trees
      - Random Forests

Contribute
====

If you know a library that has to do with Data Science, please consider [adding](https://github.com/DataHaskell/docs/edit/gh-pages/_posts/2016-10-19-wishlist.md) it, if the category it belongs to doesn't exist, suggest a category for it.

Add sections related to data science and not only Machine Learning such as Data Mining, Distributed Processing, etc
